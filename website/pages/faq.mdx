# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is PAMASIGA OS?

PAMASIGA OS is a **production-ready template** for building modern software startups. It's not a product itself, but rather a complete engineering infrastructure that you fork and customize for your own startup.

Think of it as the foundation that handles all the boring infrastructure work (CI/CD, documentation, workflows, security) so you can focus on building your unique product.

### Is PAMASIGA OS free?

Yes! PAMASIGA OS is **100% open-source** under the MIT License. You can:
- ✅ Use it for commercial projects
- ✅ Modify it however you want
- ✅ Keep your modifications private
- ✅ Sell products built on it

No attribution required (but appreciated!).

### Who is PAMASIGA OS for?

PAMASIGA OS is designed for:
- 🚀 **Startups** building SaaS products
- 👨‍💻 **Solo founders** who want professional infrastructure
- 🏢 **Development teams** standardizing their workflow
- 🎓 **Students** learning best practices
- 🔬 **Researchers** building prototypes

If you're writing code, PAMASIGA OS can help.

## Getting Started

### How do I install PAMASIGA OS?

Three simple steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the template
npx degit YOUR_ORG/pamasiga-os my-startup
cd my-startup

# 2. Run setup wizard
pnpm install && pnpm run setup

# 3. Create GitHub repo
gh repo create my-startup --public --source=. --push
```

See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation) for details.

### Do I need to know GitHub Actions?

No! All workflows are pre-configured. Just push code and they run automatically.

However, if you want to customize them, basic YAML knowledge helps. See our [Workflows Guide](/workflows).

### Can I use this with my existing project?

Yes! You can:
1. **Start fresh** - Recommended for new projects
2. **Migrate incrementally** - Copy pieces you need
3. **Learn and adapt** - Use as a reference

For migration, see [Adopting PAMASIGA OS](/adoption-guide).

## Customization

### How do I change the branding?

Everything is controlled by `startup.config.js`:

```js
branding: {
  colors: {
    primary: '#YOUR_COLOR',
    accent: '#YOUR_ACCENT'
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
pnpm run create-labels  # Update GitHub labels
cd website && pnpm build  # Rebuild docs
```

See [Configuration Guide](/getting-started/configuration).

### Can I use a different framework?

Absolutely! PAMASIGA OS is **framework-agnostic**. Use:
- Frontend: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid...
- Backend: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java...
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis...

Just add your code to the appropriate folder:
- `apps/` - Your applications
- `services/` - Your backend services
- `packages/` - Shared libraries

### How do I add Supabase/Firebase/other services?

See our integration guides:
- [Supabase Integration](/integrations/supabase)
- [Vercel Deployment](/integrations/vercel)
- [AWS Deployment](/integrations/aws)

---

## Documentation

### How do I update the docs?

Edit files in `website/pages/`:

```bash
cd website/pages
# Edit any .mdx file
vim guides/my-guide.mdx

# Push to GitHub
git add . && git commit -m "docs: update guide"
git push
```

GitHub Actions automatically rebuilds and deploys to GitHub Pages.

### Can I use a custom domain?

Yes! In your GitHub repository:
1. Go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS with your provider

See [GitHub Pages Custom Domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

### How do I add search?

Search is **built-in** with Nextra! It indexes all your markdown files automatically. No configuration needed.

For advanced search, you can integrate:
- Algolia DocSearch (free for open-source)
- Custom search with Elasticsearch
- Third-party search APIs

---

## Development

### What's the recommended workflow?

1. **Create an issue** - Describe what you're building
2. **Create a branch** - `feature/issue-123-my-feature`
3. **Write code + tests**
4. **Open a PR** - Use the template
5. **Get reviewed** - At least 1 approval
6. **Merge** - Auto-deploy via CI/CD

See [Development Workflow](/workflows/development).

### How do I run tests?

```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm test:unit

# Integration tests
pnpm test:integration

# E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# All tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

Add your test commands to `package.json`.

### How do I deploy to production?

Deployments are **automated**:
- Push to `main` → deploys to production
- Push to `develop` → deploys to staging

Configure in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

Manual deployment:
```bash
# Trigger deployment workflow
gh workflow run deploy.yml
```

## AI Development

### What are AI labels?

PAMASIGA OS tracks AI-generated code with labels:
- `AI-GENERATED` - Primarily written by AI
- `AI-SUGGESTED` - AI-assisted
- `HUMAN-REVIEWED` - AI code reviewed by human

This ensures transparency and accountability.

### Can AI commit directly?

No! AI must follow rules in `docs/AI_AGENT_RULES.md`:
- ✅ Can write code in PRs
- ✅ Can suggest improvements
- ❌ Cannot deploy to production
- ❌ Cannot modify security settings
- ❌ Cannot force-push

All AI code must be human-reviewed.

### What AI tools work with PAMASIGA OS?

All of them!
- GitHub Copilot
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- ChatGPT
- Tabnine
- Codeium

See [AI Development Guide](/guides/ai-development).

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions not running?

Check:
1. Actions enabled: **Settings → Actions → Allow all actions**
2. Workflow files exist in `.github/workflows/`
3. Syntax is valid (use YAML linter)
4. Branch protection not blocking

### Documentation site showing 404?

Check:
1. GitHub Pages enabled: **Settings → Pages**
2. Source set to `gh-pages` branch
3. `basePath` in `next.config.mjs` matches repo name
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### Labels not created?

Ensure:
1. `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated
2. You're in the repository directory
3. Run `pnpm run create-labels`
4. Check `startup.config.js` syntax

---

## Security

### How do I report a security vulnerability?

**Do NOT open a public issue.**

Instead:
1. Go to **Security → Advisories → New draft advisory**
2. Or email: security@yourcompany.com

See [Security Policy](https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/pamasiga-os/security/policy).

### What security scans are included?

PAMASIGA OS includes:
- **Dependency scanning** - `npm audit`
- **Secret scanning** - TruffleHog
- **SAST** - Semgrep
- **Code scanning** - CodeQL
- **License check** - Automated

Scans run on every PR + weekly.

### Are secrets safe?

Yes, if you follow best practices:
- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- ✅ Add secrets to `.env.example` (not `.env`)
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Use environment variables

Secret scanning catches accidental commits.
